**Global Games Sales Analysis**
This repository presents a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding trends and extracting valuable insights from global video game sales data. The project utilizes a dataset containing information on game titles, release years, genres, publishers, and sales figures across various regions including North America, Europe, Japan, and the Rest of the World, along with aggregate global sales.

**Project Objectives:**
-The primary goal is to explore and analyze the sales data of games to identify key patterns and trends. This includes:
-Identifying top-selling games globally.
-Analyzing yearly trends in game releases.
-Comparing sales growth trends for specific genres like "Action" and "Shooter".
-Visualizing regional market shares and global sales trends over time.
-Examining the contribution of different genres to regional sales.
-Identifying top publishers by game releases.
-Comparing sales markets between regions, such as Japan vs. Europe.
-Interpreting correlations between numerical features.

**Data Preprocessing and Wrangling:**
-The project includes essential data preprocessing steps such as:
-Loading the dataset using Pandas.
-Checking data types.
-Handling and dropping duplicate records.
-Checking and handling missing/null values.
-Key Observations & Insights:
-Through exploratory data analysis, the project aims to reveal insights such as:
-Global sales peaking around 2016 and declining after 2018.
-A strong positive correlation between European sales and global sales, indicating Europe's significant influence on global trends.
-A slight negative correlation between release year and sales in regions, possibly due to market saturation or evolving gaming preferences for newer games.

**Technologies Used:**
-Python 
-Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis) 
-Matplotlib (for data visualization) 

Seaborn (for statistical data visualization) 

Jupyter Notebook (for reproducible analysis and presentation) 

This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of the global video game industry through data-driven insights.
